# Córdoba's climate analysis and Monte Carlo Simulation to calculate Evaporation Rate

## Introduction

In this repository, I analyze climate data from Córdoba's City given by the National Meteorologic services of Argentina, in order to obtain the distribution of the evaporation rate for concrete from the climate date by doing a Monte Carlo Simulation.

With this distribution I was able to associate plastic crack risk with the month of the year that the concrete is being pour.

## Climate's data

The (National Meteorologic Services of Argentina)[https://www.smn.gob.ar/] in their open data policy, shared with me Córdoba's climate data from the last 60 years. You will be able to find the files with the data in this reppository. With this data, I made ridge plots of the probability distribution for each month, as can be seing in the next figures.

In the previous figures it is shown the distributions for the maximun temperatura in celsius, the relative ambient humidity and the maximun wind.
