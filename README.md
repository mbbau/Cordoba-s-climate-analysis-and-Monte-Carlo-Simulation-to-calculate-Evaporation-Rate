# Cordoba-s-climate-analysis-and-Monte-Calor-Simulation-to-calculate-Evaporation-Rate
In this repository, I analyze climate data from CÃ³rdoba's City given by the National Meteorologic services of Argentina, in order to obtain the distribution of the evaporation rate for concrete from the climate date by doing a Monte Carlo Simulation.

With this distribution I was able to associate plastic crack risk with the month of the year that the concrete is being pour.
